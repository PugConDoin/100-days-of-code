The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 28, Sunday, 2021.

## Log

### R1D1: March 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Managed to deploy Illy's Blog and scaffolded a Gatsby starter and committed to GitHub.

**Thoughts:** Starting to get to grips with React components and props. I really like Gatsby and how the site is structured through folder structure. Becoming familiar with project starts using npm and version control with Git. Need to understand styling in Gatsby better. But soon my focus will trun to JS Bootcamp and Gatsby will be for fun.

### R1D2: March 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Another Gatsby day. Gatsby Cloud. Global styles with gatsby-browser.js. Styles with CSS Modules. Nested Layout Components and Plugins. 

**Thoughts:** Continuing Gatsby journey until JS Bootcamp kicks off. Wondering about CSS in JS and how to choose between Emotion, Styled Components, Chakra and Theme UI.

### R1D4: March 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: JS Bootcamp Day Module 1 & 2: Programming basics. Problem solving. Algorithms. Flowcharts. Start Flowchart Project 1.

**Thoughts:** Going to miss spending as much time with Gatsby as I had but know that taking the time to study the principles will serve me better in the long run.
